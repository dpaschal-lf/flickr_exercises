			//make a function that displays the photos, it accepts an argument of the variable photos.  photos will be an array of photos given to us by flickr 
				//make sure the photos array has something in it.  If it does, clear the #photo-list element, if not indicate this error condition there
				//loop through all of the photos
					//define a variable to contain each photo as we loop through
					//Make a variable that will hold the URL of our photo.  Refer to https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html for more information on how to form your photo url.  You will need to pull pieces out of the photoObj, so it would be wise to console.log the variable to see which pieces you need
					//make a new img, and give it a src of the photo's url, and a width of 250, then append it to our #photo-list element
